## Abstract

This paper proposes an energy-based segmentation method facilitated by the change point detection. We apply the Kullbackâ€“Leibler (KL) divergence to demonstrate the feasibility of our method for non-Gaussian noisy images. Notably, the algorithm automatically determines whether the model is solvable using a Gaussian approach and, if not, effortlessly switches to a non-Gaussian alternative. It can also automatically determine the optimal number of classifications. Furthermore, its iterative nature enables the detection and segmentation of small regions that other methods often fail to capture. Compared to the traditional maximum between-class variance technique and recent statistical approaches, this method provides improved thresholding accuracy for bimodal grayscale images. Moreover, in the context of multiple threshold identification, the proposed method outperforms Subtractive Clustering K-Means with Filtering, Sparse Graph Spectral Clustering, Gaussian mixture on Markov random field, and Adaptive Thresholding in segmenting multimodal grayscale images.

## File Structure

This repository contains the code for the EBS and MEBS methods proposed in our paper, as well as code for other methods used for comparison.

-   `EBS Figure/`: Contains the Python implementation of the EBS (Energy-Based Segmentation) method (`EBS.py`) along with the OTSU and Kapur methods for comparison.
-   `MEBS Figure/`: Contains the Python implementation of the MEBS (Multiple Energy-Based Segmentation) method (`MEBS.py`) and code for comparison with other methods.
-   `Example1/` & `Example2/`: Contain detailed code and data for the examples used in the paper.
    -   `Example2/` includes step-by-step Python scripts from generating images and reading grayscale values to applying various methods (including EBS and GMM+MRF). It also contains some R code (`.R`) and Excel data files (`.xlsx`).
